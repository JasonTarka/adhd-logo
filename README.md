# ADHD Logo

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JasonTarka/adhd-logo/refs/heads/main/adhd-logo-white-background.svg" alt="adhd-logo" style="max-width: 150px" />

This is a logo I created help represent Attention-Deficit Hyperactive Disorder
(ADHD) and the community of those with it.

## What does it mean?

The circle and square represents the head of a [Robertson (square)
screw][robby], and the triangle a screwdriver attempting to turn it.

It's inspired by a common experience amongst those of us with ADHD of jumping
into something unprepared, whether because we misplaced the screwdriver, forgot
to pack it, or simply think it'll be faster to not go downstairs to get the 
right tool for the job.


## Where would I use this?

Anywhere that represents the ADHD community, research/educational material
related to ADHD, or resources to help those with ADHD. Some examples of where
you may want to use it:

- Online communities and forums
- Presentations
- Support groups
- Educational books
- Strategy guides on coping/working with ADHD


## Are there any limitations on its use?

Please don't use it if your only real tie to ADHD is thinking, "I sometimes get
distracted. It must be ADD!" That's like self-diagnosing yourself with diabetes
just because your blood sugar gets slightly higher after eating a large slice of
cake.
